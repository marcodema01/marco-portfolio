              Rino is a motion detector that uses machine learning to turn
              mealtime into an interactive experience. It communicates with
              guests through its balance, playfully drawing attention to the
              social moment and encouraging meaningful interaction around the
              table.

              The main challenge was to design an object capable of thought. To
              guide us, we began imagining situations where an everyday object
              could communicate with people. After exploring several scenarios,
              we were drawn to the idea of conviviality: shared meals and the
              act of being together.
              <br /> <br />
              We decided to approach the challenge with a playful mindset, both
              in what Rino would communicate and how it would do so. We were
              intrigued by the idea that the object could fall, symbolically
              "die" along with the conversation. Much like canaries in coal
              mines, Rino tips over when a guest at the table gets distracted
              and pulls out their phone.

              The first step was to design a mechanism that would allow Rino to
              fall. Our initial idea was to use a servo motor to shift a weight
              placed at the top of the object, causing it to lose balance and
              tip over.
              <br /> <br />
              Through multiple iterations, we found the right angle and weight
              needed to make our 3D-printed prototype fall as intended. The
              entire mechanism was controlled using an Arduino Nano ESP32, which
              operated the servo motor.

              To bring Rino to life, we used the ChatGPT API, connected it to a
              web interface, and programmed the Arduino to communicate with the
              web app via the computer's serial port.
              <br /> <br />
              The web app is built with JavaScript and uses the ChatGPT API to
              detect which person is using their phone. It then sends this
              information to the Arduino, triggering Rinoâ€™s response.
